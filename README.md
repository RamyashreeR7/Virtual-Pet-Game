🐶 Virtual Pet Game (Streamlit)

A fun little game built with **Python + Streamlit** where you take care of a virtual pet.  
Your pet has two needs:
- **Hunger** (goes up over time)
- **Happiness** (goes down over time)

Keep your pet alive by feeding, playing, and letting it rest.  
If hunger hits 100 or happiness drops to 0, your pet won’t survive 💔

 🚀 Features
- Simple & interactive **Streamlit web app**
- **Real-time gameplay** (hunger increases, happiness decreases as time passes)
- Three actions:
  - 🍖 Feed → decreases hunger, lowers happiness a bit  
  - 🎾 Play → increases happiness, makes pet hungrier  
  - 😴 Rest → balances both  
- Game Over screen when your pet is too sad or too hungry
